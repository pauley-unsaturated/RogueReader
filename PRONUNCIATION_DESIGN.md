I'm using the gpt-4o mini endpoint to recognize spoken words for a reading game I'm making for my kid. Is this the right model to use or should I try Whisper?  I want to have a good idea of how the mis-pronunciation is wrong when something goes wrong which is why I am thinking not Whisper.

Great project ‚Äî and good question.
GPT-4o Mini vs Whisper for Speech Recognition & Mispronunciation Feedback
Model	Strengths	Weaknesses	Fit for Your Goal
Whisper (OpenAI Speech-to-Text model)	Extremely accurate transcription, robust to noise, fast, multilingual	Outputs only text ‚Äî it does not provide details about how a word was pronounced, so you can't easily detect what was wrong in a mispronunciation	‚ùå Not ideal if you need pronunciation analysis, only for transcription correctness
GPT-4o / GPT-4o Mini with audio input	Can reason about pronunciation errors ‚Äî if given both target word + audio, it can respond with how it's being mispronounced (e.g., ‚ÄúThey said ‚Äòwabbit‚Äô instead of ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô, the /r/ is replaced with /w/‚Äù)	Not a dedicated ASR model ‚Üí raw transcription accuracy may be slightly worse than Whisper, especially in noisy environments	‚úÖ Best for feedback-based reading games
Recommendation
If your primary goal is only ‚ÄúDid they say the right word?‚Äù ‚Üí use Whisper.
*If your goal is ‚ÄúThey said it wrong ‚Äî how was it wrong?‚Äù ‚Üí stick with GPT-4o (or GPT-4o Mini).
You can even combine both:
Use Whisper to check if the transcription matches the expected word.
If mismatch ‚Üí send both the target word & the audio to GPT-4o Mini, asking:
‚ÄúThe correct word is rabbit. Analyze how the speaker pronounced it differently. Be precise about phonemes.‚Äù
This gives you fast correctness checks + intelligent feedback when needed.
If you'd like, I can help you draft a prompt template for pronunciation correction ‚Äî just let me know:
Are you sending audio files or live microphone streams?
Are you working in JavaScript / Python / Unity / something else?
Happy to help you dial this in!

Got it.  Is whisper faster? Lower latency?  Latency really matters here.
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî Whisper is significantly faster and lower latency than GPT-based audio models, especially when used in streaming mode or via the Whisper API.
Latency Comparison (Approximate)
Model / Mode	Typical Latency (short words / phrases)	Notes
Whisper API (Tiny or Base model)	100‚Äì300 ms	Fastest, good for real-time feedback
Whisper (Large model)	~500‚Äì800 ms	Higher accuracy, slightly slower
GPT-4o Mini with audio ‚Üí text	800 ms ‚Äì 1.5s	Must process audio + generate natural language, slower
GPT-4o (full)	1.2s ‚Äì 2.5s	Even slower, particularly if you're asking it to explain the pronunciation
Summary
‚úÖ If instant reaction matters (real-time reading game) ‚Üí Use Whisper for primary word detection.
üß† Only involve GPT when Whisper says it's wrong ‚Üí to analyze the mistake.
That hybrid setup gives:

Fast response most of the time
Smart feedback only when needed
Want me to draft that workflow in code (JS or Python)?
I can write you:
# Step 1: Whisper transcription
# Step 2: Compare with target
# Step 3: If mismatch ‚Üí GPT-4o Mini: "Explain how they pronounced it differently..."
Just let me know:
What language / framework are you writing your game in?
Do you want streaming (live feedback while speaking) or single-shot (after they finish a word)?
I‚Äôll tailor the snappy version for you.

If I want to pronounce the word for my kid, can I have o4-mini do that?


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 28s
Short answer: not with o4-mini itself.
o4-mini is a text model‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt synthesize audio. For pronouncing words to your kid, use OpenAI‚Äôs text-to-speech models:
tts-1 ‚Äì low-latency TTS optimized for real-time use. 
OpenAI Platform
+1
gpt-4o-mini-tts ‚Äì newer, more ‚Äústeerable‚Äù TTS (you can guide how it speaks).
OpenAI
If you also want STT (hearing the kid), there are dedicated transcribe models (gpt-4o-mini-transcribe) in addition to Whisper. 
OpenAI Platform
+1
Suggested setup for your game
Primary recognition: Whisper or gpt-4o-mini-transcribe (lower latency than GPT text models).
Explain mistakes: gpt-4o-mini (text) when there‚Äôs a mismatch.
Speak the target word: tts-1 or gpt-4o-mini-tts. (You can pre-generate and cache audio for your word list to make playback instant.) 
OpenAI Platform
+1
Minimal example (Node.js, server-side ‚Üí return MP3 to the browser)
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

// Generate pronunciation audio for a single word
export async function pronounce(word, outPath = `./${word}.mp3`) {
  const resp = await openai.audio.speech.create({
    model: "tts-1",            // or "gpt-4o-mini-tts"
    voice: "alloy",            // pick any available voice
    input: `Say the word: ${word}.`, // try: "Say it slowly: r√°b-bit." etc.
    format: "mp3"
  });
  const buf = Buffer.from(await resp.arrayBuffer());
  await fs.writeFile(outPath, buf);
  return outPath;
}
Tips
For clearer teaching, generate two clips per word: a normal one and a slow, syllable-by-syllable one (e.g., ‚Äúrabbit‚Ä¶ rab-bit‚Äù).
If latency is critical, precompute audio for your word list at startup or during install and just play files.
If you need live, sub-second playback, look at the Realtime API speech pipeline (streaming TTS). 
OpenAI Platform
If you tell me your stack (web/Unity/Python), I can drop in a ready-to-use snippet for streaming playback.

Like I'm going to need a pronunciation guide, syllable by syllable to get this right

Updated saved memory
Absolutely ‚Äî if you want to teach pronunciation (not just play the word), you'll need to generate structured speech models, not just raw audio. A good pronunciation guide system usually includes:
üß± Ideal Pronunciation Breakdown Format
For each word, generate:
Component	Example for rabbit
Full IPA (phonetic spelling)	/Ààr√¶b.…™t/
Syllable breakdown	rab ‚Äì bit
Teach-mode syllable audio	Separate clips: rab (pause) bit
Elongated phoneme audio	/r/ /√¶/ /b/ ‚Üí blended into r√¶b
Slow exaggerated version	‚ÄúRaaaab-bit.‚Äù
Call-and-response prompt	‚ÄúYour turn: say it with me. Rab‚Ä¶ bit.‚Äù
‚úÖ How to Generate This Automatically
We can script a pipeline using AI:
Text ‚Üí Phonetic Breakdown (via GPT-4o Mini)
Prompt GPT:
"Break down the word rabbit into IPA, syllables, and phonemes suitable for teaching a child."
‚Üí Output:

Word: rabbit
IPA: /Ààr√¶b.…™t/
Syllables: rab - bit
Phoneme groups (speakable): /r√¶/ - /b…™t/
Generate Audio for Each Piece (via tts-1)
One clip per syllable
One slow full word
Optional: one fun version ("Rabbit! Like a hopping rabbit!")
Combine / Sequence in UI
Let the kid tap syllables one by one, or hear auto-callout.
üîß Shall I Build You a Prototype Prompt Template?
Just answer these for me:
What style of pronunciation do you want?
American English (default)? British? Something else?
How silly / playful should the voice be?
Strict teacher? Soft narrator? Funny character?
Output format you want back?
JSON with IPA, syllables, phonemes, and tts-1-ready text per clip?
Example of What I Can Auto-Generate for You
{
  "word": "rabbit",
  "ipa": "/Ààr√¶b.…™t/",
  "syllables": ["rab", "bit"],
  "phoneme_groups": ["r√¶b", "…™t"],
  "tts_lines": [
    "Say it slowly: rab ... bit.",
    "Now say it with me: rab (pause) bit.",
    "One more time! Rabbit!"
  ]
}
Let me know the 3 answers above, and I'll:
‚úÖ Write one function that takes a word like "elephant" and returns
all its syllables + phonemes + voice lines + ready-to-generate TTS clips.
Then you‚Äôll have a plug-and-play pronunciation engine for your reading game.
