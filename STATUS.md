- ‚úÖ GitHub repository: `pauley-unsaturated/RogueReader`
- ‚úÖ Development server running at localhost:3002

## üöß Current Issues

1. **Speech Recognition Flow** - Implemented spacebar-controlled recording but has bugs:
   - Latency issues with Whisper API (trying gpt-4o-mini-transcribe)
   - Safari codec compatibility fixed (MP4/AAC)
   - Auto-recording on dialog open and after successful words
   - **Critical bugs remain in the flow that need fixing**
2. **Combat System** - Basic implementation complete, needs polish
3. **Audio System** - No audio implementation yet
4. **Game Balance** - Difficulty progression needs tuning

## üéØ Next Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay Loop (High Priority)
1. **Speech Recognition Integration** (IN PROGRESS)
   - ‚úÖ Integrated OpenAI Whisper/gpt-4o-mini-transcribe API
   - ‚úÖ Safari codec support (MP4/AAC)
   - ‚úÖ Spacebar-controlled recording flow
   - üöß **FIX CRITICAL BUGS IN RECORDING FLOW**
   - ‚è≥ Real-time pronunciation feedback
   - ‚è≥ Word accuracy scoring system

2. **Combat Mechanics** (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
   - ‚úÖ Basic combat system with spell chains
   - ‚úÖ Enemy spawning and basic interactions
   - ‚úÖ Spell effects tied to word recognition
   - ‚è≥ Enemy AI and movement improvements
   - ‚è≥ Reading failure consequences
   - ‚è≥ Victory/defeat conditions

3. **Game Progression**
   - Level completion criteria
   - XP and character advancement
   - Unlock new reading levels

### Phase 2: Content & Polish (Medium Priority)
1. **Enhanced Spell System**
   - Multiple spell types requiring different reading skills
   - Visual spell effects and animations
   - Spell book/inventory system

2. **Audio Implementation**
   - Background music and sound effects
   - Text-to-speech for word pronunciation
   - Audio feedback for correct/incorrect readings

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Better HUD and status displays
   - Reading progress visualization
   - Parent/teacher dashboard

### Phase 3: Content Expansion (Lower Priority)
1. **Additional Content**
   - More character classes beyond wizard
   - Expanded vocabulary sets
   - Story mode with narrative elements

2. **Accessibility Features**
   - Font size adjustments
   - Colorblind-friendly palettes
   - Alternative input methods

## ü§î Major Design Decisions Needed

### 1. Speech Recognition Architecture
**Options:**
- **Client-side Whisper**: Better privacy, requires local processing power
- **Cloud APIs**: More reliable, requires internet connection
- **Hybrid approach**: Fallback system with both options

**Decision needed:** Which approach fits target audience (6-year-olds) best?

### 2. Reading Failure Consequences
**Current thinking:** Make failure educational rather than punitive
**Options:**
- Gentle hints and retry opportunities
- Alternative words of similar difficulty
- Mini-games to reinforce learning

**Decision needed:** How to balance challenge with encouragement?

### 3. Parent/Teacher Integration
**Questions:**
- Should we track detailed reading analytics?
- How much parental oversight is appropriate?
- Integration with educational platforms (Google Classroom, etc.)?

**Decision needed:** Level of educational data collection and reporting.

### 4. Deployment Strategy
**Options:**
- Web-based (current): Easy distribution, works on most devices
- Native app: Better performance, app store distribution
- Progressive Web App: Best of both worlds

**Decision needed:** Primary deployment target for initial release.

### 5. Asset Generation Pipeline
**Current:** Manual sprite processing with Python scripts
**Future options:**
- AI-generated sprites for rapid content creation
- Professional artist collaboration
- Community-generated content system

**Decision needed:** Long-term asset creation strategy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling**: Animation system needs robust error handling
2. **Performance**: Large spritesheets may need optimization for mobile
3. **Testing**: No automated testing framework in place
4. **Documentation**: API documentation for systems needed

## üìä Metrics to Track

- Reading accuracy rates by level
- Time spent on different word types
- Player engagement and session length
- Difficulty progression effectiveness

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Short-term (Next 2 weeks):**
- Working speech recognition for spell casting
- Basic combat encounters with reading challenges
- Smooth gameplay loop from movement ‚Üí combat ‚Üí reading

**Medium-term (1 month):**
- 10+ hours of educational gameplay content
- Parent progress reporting
- Polished UI and game feel

**Long-term (3 months):**
- Validated educational effectiveness
- Ready for beta testing with children
- Scalable content creation pipeline
