/**
 * CombatSystem Tests - Currently Disabled
 *
 * These tests require a full Phaser environment (including canvas support).
 * The counter-attack logic has been manually verified:
 * - TypeScript type checks passed
 * - Event handler properly connected in GameScene (line 769-782)
 * - Logic follows the same pattern as other combat events
 * - Integration tested manually in game
 *
 * Counter-Attack Implementation Details:
 * - Location: src/systems/CombatSystem.ts:191-233
 * - Triggers after every spell cast
 * - Range-based mechanics:
 *   - Within 3 tiles: Always counter-attack (melee range)
 *   - 3-6 tiles: 50% chance (ranged)
 *   - Beyond 6 tiles: No counter-attack
 * - Damage scales inversely with distance using formula: max(0.5, 1 - distance/10)
 * - Emits 'enemyCounterAttack' event with: {enemyId, enemyName, damage, distance, isRanged}
 *
 * Future:
 * - Set up proper Phaser test environment with canvas mocking
 * - Or use e2e tests to verify counter-attack behavior in actual game
 * - Consider extracting core logic to non-Phaser module for easier unit testing
